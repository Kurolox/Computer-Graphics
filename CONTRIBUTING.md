# Contributing

This is a project that is for the community and its true essence is only possible when it is community driven.

Please feel free to contribute to this project and be a part of this. Anything from raising issues to adding new features or even a typo in documentations, all are welcome. Please report issues here [https://github.com/jainrocky/Computer-Graphics/issues](https://github.com/jainrocky/Computer-Graphics/issues). It is also recommended to go through the Contributions Best Practices below to help organize contributions :smiley:


## Contributions Best Practices

### Commits

* Write clear meaningful git commit messages (Do read [http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/))

* When you make minor changes to a PR of yours, make sure you squash your commits afterwards so that you don't have an absurd number of commits for a single PR. (Learn how to squash commits at [https://davidwalsh.name/squash-commits-git](https://davidwalsh.name/squash-commits-git))


### Issues

Feel free to open up any issue in the repository, whether it is about code improvements or bug fixes or documentation. You can also use any label you want to associate with the issue. Please provide a clear description of the issue while filing it :smiley:
